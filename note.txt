Unit Testing in JUnit:
1. If there are no failures in a Junit test then it means test has succeeded / fast
2. Function signature should be public void
3. We should have one condition in a particular test
3. assertEqual, both values should be same or else it fails
4. We can pass in a String in every Assert function that will be printed as message if test fails
5. @Before to execute something before running every test for ex. to initialize test data
6. @After to execute something after executing every test for cleanup for ex. disconnect to DB
7. @BeforeClass and @AfterClass if we want to do only once not after every test
8. Both methods should be *static (ie. methods with these annotations)
